/// Gaving Wood: Solidity was designed by Gavin Wood and developed by Christian Reitwiessner, Alex Beregszaszi,
/// and several former Ethereum core contributors. Programs in Solidity run on Ethereum Virtual Machine or on compatible virtual machines.
/// First appeared: August 2014, Implementation language: C++
/// Gensis Block: It's the first block in a blockchain
/// As of september 15, 2022 ETH is proof of work
/// PoW uses a lot of energy
/// PoW we call it miners and in PoS we call it validators
/// Layer 1: Base layer blockchain implementation ( BTC, ETH, AVAX etc )
/// Layer 2: Any Application built on top of layer 1 ( Chailink, ARBITRIUM, OP )
/// Rollups derive their security from base layer
/// Side chains derive their security from their own protocols
/// Sharding and rollups are scalability solutions on layer 1
